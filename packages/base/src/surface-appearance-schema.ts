 * Single source of truth for the surface appearance schema.

 * Describes how to draw the face of a surface: its extent, its background, and where each of its
 * controls sits. Layered over a surface layout and keyed by the same control ids, but optional
 * where the layout is required, so a malformed one is discarded rather than failing the surface.
 *
 * Origin top-left, y down. Distances are in the units of `size` and only the ratios within one face
 * matter. An svg background must use a `viewBox` of `0 0 <size.width> <size.height>`.
