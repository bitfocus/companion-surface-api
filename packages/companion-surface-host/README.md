# @companion-surface/host

Host-side wrapper library for Companion Surface plugins.

This package provides the host-side API that wraps the modules written with the `@companion-surface/base` API with additional logic that runs in-process. It is designed to support multiple versions of the base API and provide a uniform interface back to the host application.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @companion-surface/host
```

## Usage
